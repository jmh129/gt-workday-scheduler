## Introduction
This app was developed as part of HW 5 of the Georgia Institute of Technology Fullstack Coding Bootcamp. The goal of the project was to create an app using HTML, JQuery and Moment.js that helps keep track of the users work schedule. The app time slots change color based off the current time. Gray for past, Red for current, and Green for future.
